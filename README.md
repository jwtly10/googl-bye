# GooGL-Bye

Google recently announced the discontinuation of their URL shortening service. 

https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available/

This Go project is designed to help developers prepare for this, by automating the process of finding and expanding goo.gl URLs in GitHub repositories, with plans to automatically raise issues/PRs for affected repositories.

## Features
- Search for repositories on GitHub (given criteria or specific Url/Author** )
- Clone repositories locally
- Parse cloned repositories for goo.gl URLs
- Expand found goo.gl URLs
- Save expanded URLs to a database
- (Planned) Automatically raise issues in repositories with goo.gl URLs**
- Web interface for signing in & scanning private repositories (or all repos in account)**

** Not yet implemented, but planned
